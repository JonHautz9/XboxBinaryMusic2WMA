# XboxBinaryMusic2WMA

This script was written for Python 3.3 and Xbox 360 music files.

Simply run in the directory with the binaries and it will save them to a .wma format.
It will create an ID for each file and place it before the title of each song which is extracted from the binaries' header.
It will then find the end of the header and write the rest into a directory cleverly titled WMA.
